# Google-Keep Application

## Simple Setup and Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Your React App

1. **Create a new React app** named `google-keep`:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app google-keep
   cd google-keep
   ```

2. **Open the project in VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will open your app in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 2: Customize Your App

- Modify the files in the `src/` directory to build your Google Keep clone according to your requirements.

### Step 3: Build Your App

1. **Build your app** for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates an optimized bundle of your app in the `build` folder.

### Step 4: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Sign up or log in to Netlify** at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/).

2. **Drag and drop your `build` folder** onto the Netlify dashboard, or:
   - Connect your Git repository to Netlify.
   - Set the build command to `npm run build` and the publish directory to `build`.
   - Deploy your app either manually or set up continuous deployment.

### Step 5: Done!

- Your Google Keep clone should now be live at the provided Netlify URL.  [https://google-keep-application.netlify.app/](https://google-keep-application.netlify.app/)
